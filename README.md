# Fundamental-Algorithms-Implementation
This is a repository of some implementation of the algorithms introduced in Fundamental Algorithms CSCI-GA 1170.
## Why I did this?
Sometimes the homework involves some complex computations. Then I thought of that it is a CS course, why not let the computer to do the job? So, I programed to check my answers and it turned out to be fun! (and painful but never mind).
## Is this cheating?
I don't think so. First, I am not using programs to directly generate the answers. I am just checking my answers. And I implemented the codes myself with the help of references and that is allowed. (When you are doing homework, you also need references right?) And I also give the links of the references. Actually, I can learn more extensively and deeply by implementing the algorithms in coding.
The thing is, when you try to implement an algorithm in the text book, it is totally different from doing hand simulations on paper. You only need to solve that specific case on the paper and there might be some cases that are not covered, but when coding, the goal is always to implement a program to handle all of the situations. So, when implementing an algorithm, I tended to think more about the algorithm and try to come up with test cases as many as possible.
## NOTICE!
DO NOT directly use the program to do the homework only because you are LAZY!
DO the homework ON YOUR OWN!
I have spent hours on these programs, for more than just doing homework and learned a lot.
